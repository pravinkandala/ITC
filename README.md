Cloud Storage delivers virtualized storage on demand, which eliminates the need to purchase storage and maintaining 
the data. This is very much helpful for the small and medium size business, where establishing the data center and 
maintenance of the data center is tedious process. On the other hand backing up of data is essential for recovering
our system from the data loss. The cloud provides such as storing large amounts of data, high reliability and data 
access from any place at any point of time. The main idea of this paper is to propose an interface (plug-in) which 
facilitates the back up of data stored in local disk on to the cloud. The interface that is to be designed will work 
on both windows and Linux operating systems. The interface will also provide the user to back up the data on the cloud 
platforms such as Google App Engine and Amazon S3. The interface allows the user to select any of the backup 
techniques that is either Full Back up or Incremental Backup.
